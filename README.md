# What mortgage should I get
Am I better off with a 30yr or 15yr fixed mortgage?

Yes, we all know that with 30yr mortgage, we get lower monthly payment, but way more interest payment throught the length of the debt.

But many people sell the house before they paid off the debt. If one is only to hold the property for a few years, which mortgage gives you a better return on you investment?
